# Unsupervised-Learning
Iris Flower Clustering Project

In this project, I aim to cluster Iris flowers using petal width and length features from the Iris dataset in sklearn. To simplify, I'll drop sepal width and length features. I'll also investigate if preprocessing, like scaling, is helpful and determine the optimal 'k' value using the Elbow Method.

Project Steps

Load Iris dataset, extract petal width and length.

Examine data preprocessing (scaling) necessity.

Apply K-Means clustering.

Find optimal cluster count with Elbow Method.

Visualize results.
